It took me awhile to realize that I could think about the

VASS & petri-net as a type of crystal - it's a set space that has certain assumpsions


Normally - you look at a static net. one where the intial state of the system is always constant.

If this is extended to treat the network as having adjustable values
that are coupled to another parallel network. Then we can effectively model a much more dynamic system.

Do we lose provablility because we allow turing completeness?
I'd love to hear opinions on that.

With certainty we gain a method for contructing a mathematical model from a tokenized market.

This is an approach for designing a general protocol for side-chains.
A general protocol will allow users to construct systems that span multiple blockchain protocols.

One byproduct of this construction is that every aspect of the system has been identified.

Some values are immutable - others are bound to variables that the protocol can compute.


These variables are either computed from on-chain oracle values or 
they are derived by using formla from that data.

TODO: add some examples

TODO: how could this relate to ML ?
